# Title (Regex Through Email Validation)
In today's digital age, validating input data is crucial for ensuring the integrity and functionality of our applications. One common piece of data that requires validation is an email address. In this tutorial, we will dissect a regex pattern used for email validation, explaining each component in detail to provide a thorough understanding of how regex works.

## Summary

This tutorial will break down the regex pattern used to validate email addresses, explaining each part of the expression and its role in the validation process. We will explore different regex components such as anchors, quantifiers, character classes, and more. Here is the regex pattern we will be discussing:^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$

## Regex Components

### Anchors

'^' and '$' are used to match the start and end of a line, ensuring the whole string matches the pattern.

### Quantifiers

'+' is used after brackets to indicate one or more occurrences of the preceding element.

### OR Operator

Not explicitly used in this pattern, but useful in other contexts for providing alternatives.

### Character Classes

'[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]' matches any letter (both cases), digit, dot, underscore, percent, plus, or hyphen.
'[a-zA-Z0-9.-]' matches any letter (both cases), digit, dot, or hyphen.

### Flags

No specific flags are used in this pattern.

### Grouping and Capturing

Everything within '()' is treated as a single unit. Here, it helps to apply quantifiers to the entire user name or domain part.

### Bracket Expressions

Enclosed in square brackets, it defines a set of characters to match.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

Not specifically discussed in this pattern, but important in controlling regex behavior.

### Boundaries

'.' represents a boundary as it separates the domain and TLD.

### Back-references

Not used in this regex pattern.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind

Not used in this pattern but can be critical in more complex regex tasks.
